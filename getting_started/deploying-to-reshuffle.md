# Deploying to Reshuffle
This section covers deploying your local code back to Reshuffle. We assume you have read and executed the steps in the [previous section](https://dev.reshuffle.app/running-locally). 

**1. Run the deploy script**

Once you have a locally working app you are happy with, you will want to deploy it back to Reshuffle. In your command line, go  the projectâ€™s root folder and run:

```js
npx reshuffle deploy
```

If you have not authenticated before, this script will walk you through a web authentication process using your GitHub account. This authentication process ensures only you can deploy and manage your apps.

Once you connect your GitHub account, return to the command line. At this point, Reshuffle CLI might prompt you to select the project you want to deploy to. This only happens when Reshuffle is unsure  which app you are targeting for deployment. After this is done, Reshuffle will deploy your app (including both backend and frontend) to your online app.  

You're done! Enjoy your new app!

**2. Bonus points: Join the community**
