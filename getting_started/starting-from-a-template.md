# Getting started with Reshuffle

Thank you for choosing Reshuffle, you are awesome! This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating, updating and deploying your first app on Reshuffle. We assume basic [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) coding skills, and that you know how to use [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

**1. Pick a template as your starting point**

At Reshuffle, every app starts from a template. Reshuffle templates are a great way to get the scaffolding out of the way and start with a working app. If you prefer to start from scratch you can always pick the [blank](https://reshuffle.com/template/blank) template as your starting point.

So, in order to get started, hop on to [reshuffle.com](https://reshuffle.com/), pick a template that suits you, and click on it for a preview.

**2. Preview the template** 

Clicking a template takes you to a live preview you can evaluate. This is a fully functional, private to you, version of the app this template delivers. It will not be linked to your account until you click Remix. If the template does not meet your needs, you can always go back and pick another one. Play around with the template to experience the interaction, and see if it’s what you’re looking for. Once you found a template that fits your needs - hit the Remix button to make it your own.

**3. Remix to make it your own**

Once you hit Remix, the app is deployed and linked to your account (At this point, you will be asked to log-in, if you haven't done so already) - you are now the proud owner of a Reshuffle app! Now you will be able to modify the template and make it your own. The post Remix page contains useful information about downloading the template code and associating it with your app. You can also find this information in the app settings page accessible through the My Apps menu item.
